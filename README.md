PROCESS:

- Create design layout in figma:
  - Mobile:
  - Desktop:
- Create simple HTML/CSS structure with mock text.
- Pull data from local mock data. 
- Implement fetch APIs and display fetched data
  - Using useState and useContext for state management.
- Refactor state management using Redux Toolkit
- Refactor all javascript with TypeScript:
  - Fetch APIs
  - Redux Toolkit

note: I have decided to first make a workable project using React and vanilla JavaScript. I will then refactor my project with any extra tooling that I would like to bring in (TypeScript and Redux). The reasoning behind this is multifaceted: 
- to get a better idea of the pros/cons of these tools by seeing a project with/without them
- gives me an opportunity to go over my code base multiple times, potentially allowing me to notice ways to increase its readability/effeciency
